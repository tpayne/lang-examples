# Temperature: This parameter controls the randomness of the output. 
# A lower temperature (closer to 0) makes the output more 
# deterministic and focused, while a higher temperature (up to 1) 
# allows for more creativity and variability.

# Top-p (Nucleus Sampling): This parameter controls the diversity
# of the output by considering only the top p probability mass. 
# A lower value makes the model consider fewer options, leading
