**You:**
connect to the schema my_company_db in the database jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_company_db?user=root

**Bot:**
<p>Successfully connected to the database <code>my_company_db</code>. You can now proceed with database operations or queries as needed. If you have any specific actions in mind, please let me know!</p>


**You:**
what tables are in this schema?

**Bot:**
<p>The following tables are present in the schema <code>my_company_db</code>:</p>

* <strong>customer_details</strong>

* <strong>invoice</strong>

* <strong>order_items</strong>

* <strong>orders</strong>

* <strong>products</strong>

* <strong>stock</strong>

* <strong>suppliers</strong>

<p>If you need further information about any of these tables, please let me know!</p>


**You:**
analyse this schema for tables, cols that have potential pii information in them that need masking. Just tell me the table (column) name and a one line summary why it needs masking

**Bot:**
<p>Here’s the analysis of the tables in the <code>my_company_db</code> schema that contain potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII) requiring masking:</p>

* <strong>customer_details (customer_name)</strong>: Contains the customer's name, which can be used to identify individuals.

* <strong>customer_details (customer_address)</strong>: Contains the physical address of the customer, which can be used to locate and identify them.

* <strong>customer_details (bank_sort_code)</strong>: Contains bank details that can be used for financial identification and transactions.

* <strong>customer_details (bank_account_number)</strong>: Sensitive bank account information that directly links to an individual's financial resources.

* <strong>suppliers (contact_person)</strong>: Reflects the name of a contact person, identifying an individual associated with the supplier.

* <strong>suppliers (phone)</strong>: Contains the phone number of the contact person, which can be used for direct identification.

* <strong>suppliers (email)</strong>: Contains the email address of the contact person, allowing for direct communication and identification.

<p>These fields should be masked to protect the employees' and customers' privacy and comply with data protection regulations. If you need further details or actions to be taken, please let me know!</p>


**You:**
does this database and the data in it have any data quality issues I need to be worried about?

**Bot:**
<p>Here are the potential data quality issues identified in the database:</p>
<h3>1. <code>customer_details</code></h3>

* <strong>Duplicates</strong>: There are identical records, indicating potential duplicate entries (e.g., multiple "Alice Smith" with the same details). This can lead to inconsistencies and confusion in customer-related processes.

* <strong>Missing Data</strong>: While no missing values were reported, ensuring that crucial fields (e.g., bank details) aren't null is important for completeness.

<h3>2. <code>orders</code></h3>

* <strong>Missing Data</strong>: The <code>status</code> field may contain null or empty values, which can hinder tracking the order state.

* <strong>Customer Number Validity</strong>: The <code>customer_number</code> must correspond to existing customers in the <code>customer_details</code> table. Any discrepancies could indicate referential integrity issues.

<h3>3. <code>suppliers</code></h3>

* <strong>Missing Data</strong>: Fields such as <code>contact_person</code>, <code>phone</code>, and <code>email</code> can be null, which might impair communication with suppliers. Ensuring these fields are filled can improve the relationship management process.

* <strong>Duplicates</strong>: No duplicates noted in the analysis, but it's essential to monitor if suppliers can have identical attributes.

<h3>Summary:</h3>

* <strong>Duplicates</strong> in <code>customer_details</code> require deduplication processes.

* Ensure <strong>completeness</strong> of key columns in each table.

* Verify <strong>referential integrity</strong> between <code>orders</code> and <code>customer_details</code>.

<p>These issues could affect the efficiency and accuracy of operations involving these tables. Addressing them would improve data integrity, reliability, and overall quality. If you need specific actions or further analysis, feel free to ask!</p>


**You:**
can you create sql scripts to fix these issues?

**Bot:**
<p>Certainly! Below are SQL scripts to address the identified data quality issues in the <code>my_company_db</code> schema.</p>
<h3>1. Addressing Duplicates in <code>customer_details</code></h3>
```
<code class="language-sql">-- Remove duplicates from customer_details, keeping only one entry for each unique customer
DELETE c1
FROM customer_details c1
INNER JOIN customer_details c2
ON c1.customer_number > c2.customer_number 
AND c1.customer_name = c2.customer_name 
AND c1.customer_address = c2.customer_address
AND c1.bank_sort_code = c2.bank_sort_code 
AND c1.bank_account_number = c2.bank_account_number 
AND c1.bank_name = c2.bank_name;
</code>
```
<h3>2. Ensuring Completeness in <code>customer_details</code></h3>
```
<code class="language-sql">-- UPDATE statements to set default values where critical fields are NULL
UPDATE customer_details
SET bank_sort_code = 'UNKNOWN' WHERE bank_sort_code IS NULL;

UPDATE customer_details
SET bank_account_number = 'UNKNOWN' WHERE bank_account_number IS NULL;
</code>
```
<h3>3. Validating Customer Numbers in <code>orders</code></h3>
```
<code class="language-sql">-- DELETE orders with invalid customer_numbers that don’t exist in customer_details
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE customer_number NOT IN (SELECT customer_number FROM customer_details);
</code>
```
<h3>4. Ensuring Completeness in <code>orders</code></h3>
```
<code class="language-sql">-- UPDATE statements for setting a default 'Pending' status where NULL or empty
UPDATE orders 
SET status = 'Pending' WHERE status IS NULL OR status = '';
</code>
```
<h3>5. Ensuring Completeness in <code>suppliers</code></h3>
```
<code class="language-sql">-- UPDATE statements to ensure essential supplier data are not null
UPDATE suppliers 
SET contact_person = 'UNKNOWN' WHERE contact_person IS NULL;

UPDATE suppliers 
SET phone = 'UNKNOWN' WHERE phone IS NULL;

UPDATE suppliers 
SET email = 'UNKNOWN' WHERE email IS NULL;
</code>
```
<h3>Execution Note:</h3>

* These SQL scripts need to be executed in a safe environment, preferably after taking a backup of the existing data.

* Review the logic for updating or deleting records to ensure it aligns with the business requirements and data integrity policies in place.

<p>Feel free to reach out if you require any modifications or additional scripts!</p>
