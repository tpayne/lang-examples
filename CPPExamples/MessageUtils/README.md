# MessageUtils

This code is a network app I wrote a long time ago for communicating with Yahoo and MSN before they were stopped.

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/tpayne/MessageUtils/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tpayne/MessageUtils/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

It is here as an example of network code (could do with a lot of updating for later C++ constructs).

Note: I never completed this application or got it to work properly as it was primarily for play purposes and working out a simple network protocol, so I accept no liability or responsibility it not working. Use it at your own risk.

NOTE - This will never work as the protocols are no longer available. However, it is useful for a basis for CPP based network protocols, but the program itself does not work, so no point running it.
